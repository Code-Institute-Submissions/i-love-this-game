Michael will rip your heart out. If you give Michael an opening, he will kill you. Michael smells blood. Michael is going for the jugular. Nobody goes for the kill like Michael Jordan. They&rsquo;re on life support and Michael is pulling the plug. Michael will eat your liver and cap it off with a glass of Chianti.&rdquo;I made up only the last line; everything else was definitely muttered by an announcer between 1988 and 1998. Our society enabled the competitor that Michael Jordan became: we value athletes who treasure winning, maximize their own potential, stay in superior shape, pump their fists, slap asses and would rather maim themselves then lose a game. Ronnie Lott had part of his pinkie amputated in the offseason in order to keep playing in the NFL. We thought this was awesome. We loved Ronnie Lott for this. Now that&rsquo;s a guy who cares! Tiger won the 2008 U.S. Open playing with a torn ACL. Now that&rsquo;s a champion! Pete Rose bowled over Ray Fosse to score the winning run in the 1970 All-Star Game, separating Fosse&rsquo;s shoulder and altering his career. Hey, you don&rsquo;t block home plate when it&rsquo;s Pete Rose! We will always love the guys who care just a little more than everyone else, just like we will always hate the ones who don&rsquo;t. Why? Because we like to think that we&rsquo;d play that way if we were blessed with those same gifts. Or something.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThat&rsquo;s why we never judged Michael Jordan for his competitive disorder. If anything, we deified it. The man could do anything and it was okay. From 1984 to 1991, by all accounts &ndash; magazines, newspapers, books, you name it &ndash; Jordan pulled all the same shit that Kobe did this decade, only in a more indefensible and debilitating way. When Sam Smith finally called him out in his turned-outto-be-totally-accurate 1992 book, &ldquo;The Jordan Rules&rdquo;, everyone reacted like we would now if Perez Hilton started lobbing online grenades at Obama&rsquo;s daughters. Jordan couldn&rsquo;t be an asshole, and even if he was, we didn&rsquo;t want to know. By the time Kobe rose to prominence, our society had become much more cynical: we gravitated toward tearing people down over building them up, so that&rsquo;s what we did. Had Jordan come along fifteen years later, the same thing would have happened to him.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOf course, Kobe&rsquo;s diva routine happened out of weakness: he couldn&rsquo;t figure out his own identity and settled on a slightly creepy Jordan impression, pursuing that goal by trying to excel on both ends (did it), win a few rings (did it), score as many points as possible (did it), mimic Jordan&rsquo;s celebratory fist pump (did it) and lead his own team to the title (didn&rsquo;t do it). Everything about Kobe&rsquo;s handling of the inevitable transition from &ldquo;the Robin to Shaq&rsquo;s Batman&rdquo; to &ldquo;Batman&rdquo; was clumsy. Jordan always knew who he was. He had to win at everything. He studied up on opponents and searched for any signs of weakness, even pumping beat writers and broadcasters for insider information. He soaked teammates in poker on team flights so brutally that coaches warned rookies to stay away. He lost in Ping-Pong to teammate Rod Higgins once, bought a table and became the best Ping-Pong player on the team. He dunked on Utah&rsquo;s John Stockton once, heard Utah owner Larry Miller scream, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you pick on someone your own size?&rdquo;, then dunked on center Mel Turpin and hissed at Miller afterward, &ldquo;He big enough for you?&rdquo;. He bribed airport baggage guys to put out his suitcase first once, then wagered teammates that his bag would be the first one on the conveyor belt. He stormed out of a Bulls scrimmage once like a little kid because he thought Doug Collins screwed up the score. When a team of college All-Stars outscored the Dream Team in a half-assed scrimmage and made the mistake of puffing their chests out, Jordan started out the next day&rsquo;s scrimmage by pointing at Allan Houston and simply saying, &ldquo;I got him&rdquo;&hellip;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&hellip; and Houston didn&rsquo;t touch the ball for two hours.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJordan measured everything by the result and every teammate by his capacity to care about that result. He tested them constantly and weeded out the ones who folded: Dennis Hopson, Brad Sellers, Will Perdue, Stacey King&hellip; it&rsquo;s a longer list than you think. He punched teammates in practice to reassert his dominance.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn the early years, he went too far and his bloodthirsty fire crippled a few of his teams; you never want to affect teammates to the degree that they&rsquo;re afraid to assert themselves in big games. Craig Hodges told Michael Wilbon about a 1990 incident in which Pippen made the mistake of challenging Jordan in practice, when Michael &ldquo;proceeded, literally, to score on Scottie at will. It was incredible. I mean, Scottie Pippen even then was one of the best players in the league and Michael just rained points on him. Scottie had to step back and say, &lsquo;Slow up, man.&rsquo;&rdquo; For years and years, Jordan couldn&rsquo;t rein himself in. He cared about winning, but only on his terms &ndash; he also wanted to win scoring titles, drop 50 whenever he pleased and treat his teammates like the biggest bully in a prison block &ndash; which led Phil Jackson to adopt the triangle offense in a last-ditch effort to prevent Jordan from hogging the ball (and, Jackson hoped, embolden his supporting cast). By the 1991 playoffs, when his teammates had advanced to an acceptable level, Jordan found a workable balance between involving them and taking over big moments. The rest was history.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYou know Jordan&rsquo;s &ldquo;best ever&rdquo; credentials: his playoff chops, individual records and all-around honors surpass those of anyone else who ever played. He owns more iconic moments than anyone: the 63-point game at the Garden, the &rsquo;87 Slam Dunk Contest, &ldquo;the shot&rdquo; against the &rsquo;88 Cavs, the &ldquo;Ohhhhhh, a spec -tack- ular move!&rdquo; layup in the &rsquo;91 Finals, those 6 threes in the &rsquo;92 Finals (along with the shrug &ndash; you can&rsquo;t forget the shrug), 41 points per game in the 1993 Finals, the 72-win team in &rsquo;96, the Flu Game in &rsquo;97 and The Last Shot in &rsquo;98. He demoralized eight memorable teams in eight years&mdash;the Bad Boy Pistons, the Showtime Lakers, Riley&rsquo;s Knicks, Drexler&rsquo;s Blazers, Barkley&rsquo;s Suns, Shaq&rsquo;s Magic, Malone&rsquo;s Jazz and Miller&rsquo;s Pacers &ndash; and none was ever quite the same. He accomplished everything with just two Pyramid teammates (Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman) and a bunch of role players and pseudo-scrubs. When he captured that last title in 1998, we all agreed: &ldquo;This is the greatest basketball player we will ever see&rdquo;. That didn&rsquo;t stop us from looking for the next him. We spent the next eleven years anointing false successors, hyping young stars who weren&rsquo;t ready and overrating imitators who weren&rsquo;t really him. We need to stop looking.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy personal belief: nobody will surpass Jordan. Ever. LeBron might approach him someday, and if not him, someone else. You will instinctively want to pass the torch to that person. That&rsquo;s just the way this stuff works. Again, we always want the Next One to be greater than the Last One, and it&rsquo;s impossible for the Last One to keep defending the title once memories start fading. Just remember that Superstar X can&rsquo;t pass Jordan solely by putting up triple-doubles, breaking scoring records and winning multiple titles. They have to beat a force of personality that compares to presidents and tycoons. They have to surpass a competitiveness better suited for a dictator. They have to keep peaking well after we believed they could keep peaking. They have to remain the coolest person in the room long after there&rsquo;s any tangible reason for them to hold that title.

By 1985, Bill Cosby, Eddie Murphy, Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen were the four biggest stars on the planet, the Cold War was at an all-time fervor, and Kareem was still cranking out Finals MVP trophies.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOnly Jack Nicklaus can claim such extended athletic superiority, winning the Masters twenty-three years apart (1963 and 1986) &ndash; but really, what&rsquo;s more impressive, peaking over fifteen years in basketball, or peaking over twenty-three years in a sport that can be played with love handles and a potbelly? Kareem made first-team All-NBA&rsquo;s fifteen seasons apart. From 1971 to 1980, he captured six MVP awards and should have won seven. For the first seven years of his career, he averaged a 30-16-5 with 54 percent shooting. For the first twelve years (1970-1981), he never averaged less than a 24-10. From 1970 to 1986 (an astonishing seventeen-year span), he averaged between 21.5 and 34.5 points and made between 51 percent and 60 percent of his shots. He&rsquo;s one of the most durable superstars in sports history, missing just 80 of 1640 regular season games, cracking the 80-plus mark eleven times, playing 237 of a possible 238 playoff games and logging over 65,000 minutes in all. He played for six championship teams. He reached eleven Finals and fourteen Conference Finals. His teams averaged 56 wins per season, dipped below .500 just twice and finished with a .600-plus winning percentage sixteen times. After his fortieth birthday, the &rsquo;87 Lakers called consecutive &ldquo;we must score or we will lose&rdquo; plays for him in the last 45 seconds of their biggest game (Game 4 at Boston): a delayed screen/alley-oop that tied it, then a post play in which he drew a foul. In a do-or-die Game 6 of the &rsquo;88 Finals, the Lakers called time with 27 seconds to play, trailing by one, and ran their biggest play of the season for their forty-one-year-old center; he drew a foul and nailed both free throws for the eventual victory.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThey relied on him at that advanced age for one reason: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was the surest two points in NBA history. Listed at 7-foot-2 but definitely two inches taller &ndash; at least &ndash; his unstoppable sky hook remains the only basketball shot that couldn&rsquo;t be blocked, an artistic achievement because of its consistency and efficiency. Every sky hook looked the same: in one motion, Kareem blocked off the defender with his left arm, swung his right arm over his head, reached as high as he could and flicked the basketball with his right wrist. Swish. Since defenders couldn&rsquo;t dream of challenging the release, they settled on making him miserable, pounding him like a blocking sled &ndash; with tacit approval from the officials, of course &ndash; turning every 9-footer into a 13-footer and living with the odds from there. What else could they do? Kareem never needed a plan B, making him the &ldquo;Groundhog Day&rdquo; of NBA superstars. Fans struggled for ways to connect with him and failed, incapable of being thrilled by someone so predictable and aloof. Maybe it didn&rsquo;t help that Kareem skipped the &rsquo;68 Olympics in protest of America&rsquo;s racial climate, or that he bristled at the public&rsquo;s uneasiness about his religion and resented everyone&rsquo;s impossibly high expectations. He handled every interview like he was disarming a hand grenade: too smart for dumb questions, too serious for frivolous jokes, too reserved for any semblance of personal candor. Unlike Chamberlain, he didn&rsquo;t have a compulsive need to be loved; he just wanted to be left alone. And for the most part, that&rsquo;s what fans did. When he changed his name a few weeks after Milwaukee won the &rsquo;71 title, the NBA&rsquo;s dominant player was suddenly an introverted, intermittently sullen Muslim who towered over every center except Wilt, abhorred the press, relied on a robotic hook shot and pushed away the general public. You wouldn&rsquo;t exactly throw in a &ldquo;Good times!&rdquo; to end the previous sentence.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut that&rsquo;s how it went through the 1970s. We kept hoping someone would supplant him and nobody did. Kareem&rsquo;s public stature suffered for four unrelated reasons: the goofy combination of his afro, facial hair and goggles added to his detachment (it almost seemed like a Halloween mask); his trade demands (Milwaukee finally obliged in 1975) made him seem like just another petulant black athlete who wanted his way (the public perception, not the reality); 1977&rsquo;s sucker punch of Kent Benson went over like a fart in church; and his ongoing battle with migraines made fans wonder if he was looking for excuses not to play. So what if the goggles were a result of his eyes getting poked so many times that doctors worried about permanent damage, that Benson elbowed him first, that Milwaukee had a lousy supporting cast and no Muslim population, that his headaches left him unable to function? Kareem never received the benefit of the doubt &ndash; not from anyone, not once, not ever. People grumbled that he didn&rsquo;t give a crap, mailed in games, played on cruise control, failed to make teammates better and only cared about money. That perception faded once Magic turned the Lakers into the league&rsquo;s most entertaining team, breathing life into Kareem&rsquo;s career in the process. &ldquo;Sports Illustrated&rdquo; ran a January 1980 feature with the headline &ldquo;A Different Drummer&rdquo; and the subhead &ldquo;After years of moody introspection, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is coming out of his shell.&rdquo; He made a well-received cameo in a comedy called &ldquo;Airplane&rdquo; that blew everyone away, playing himself as a pilot with the alias &ldquo;Roger Murdock.&rdquo; A young passenger recognizes him and &ldquo;Roger&rdquo; denies it, leading to this exchange:KID: &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re the greatest, but my dad says you don&rsquo;t work hard enough on defense. And he says that lots of times, you don&rsquo;t even run down court. And that you don&rsquo;t really try&hellip; except during the playoffs.&rdquo;KAREEM: &ldquo;The hell I don&rsquo;t. Listen, kid, I&rsquo;ve been hearing that crap ever since I was at UCLA. I&rsquo;m out there busting my buns every night. Tell your old man to drag Walton and Lanier up and down the court for 48 minutes!&rdquo;On his last scene, when Kareem was being lugged from the cockpit with his Lakers uniform and goggles on, everyone had the same reaction. &ldquo;Kareem has a sense of humor? What?&rdquo; He would have cruised to 1980&rsquo;s Comeback Personality of the Year Award if his single greatest playing moment &ndash; when he sprained an ankle in Game 5 of the &rsquo;80 Finals, limped back in with the Lakers trailing, finished off a 40-point performance on one leg and willed them to a crucial victory &ndash; hadn&rsquo;t happened on tape delay and been overshadowed by Magic&rsquo;s series-clinching 42-15-7 two days later. Just like that, Kareem&rsquo;s likability window had closed. The struggling Association moved forward with Bird and Magic, hitting its stride in the mid-eighties as Kareem settled into a new role as the aging &ldquo;How the hell is he still doing it?&rdquo; superstar. And here&rsquo;s where memories can be unfair: Kareem&rsquo;s last six seasons (1984-89) unfortunately doubled as his most-seen stretch because the league&rsquo;s TV ratings took off. Few remember him demolishing the &rsquo;71 Bullets, sinking the season-saving sky hook in double OT of the &rsquo;74 Finals or hobbling around to save the &rsquo;80 Finals; everyone remembers when he couldn&rsquo;t rebound, couldn&rsquo;t keep Moses off the boards (Kareem was thirty-six at the time, by the way), couldn&rsquo;t protect the rim, slowed L.A.&rsquo;s fast break, lost his hair and hung around for one awkward season too long. The thing that made him greater than Wilt &ndash; his staggering longevity &ndash; wounded the perception of his career after the fact. Wilt broke every record. Russell won eleven titles. Jordan dominated the nineties. Kareem? He&rsquo;s the moody guy who peaked during the NBA&rsquo;s darkest era and wouldn&rsquo;t leave when it was time. What&rsquo;s fun about celebrating that?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar may have been fun to dislike &ndash; and believe me, I did &ndash; but his greatness cannot be denied. He&rsquo;s the third-best basketball player of all time. Better than Oscar. Better than Wilt. Better than Magic or Bird.

He&rsquo;s one of the most famous college players and professional players ever. He had an iconic game (Game 6, 1980) and iconic moment (the baby sky hook). He played in ten championship finals over a thirteen-year span, taking home six titles in all. He co-captained the single greatest basketball team ever assembled (the &rsquo;92 Dream Team). He starred in the greatest Finals ever (1984). He had one of the best porn names ever, but became so famous so fast that we never realized it. He battled Erving, Bird, Moses, Isiah and Jordan in the Finals over the span of twelve years as the league evolved from tape delay to mainstream. He meshed with his city on and off the court like nobody in league history. He was called a savior, a winner, a coach-killer, a choke artist and a loser, and then a winner again&hellip; and his prime hadn&rsquo;t even happened yet. He became the first man to kiss another man in prime time. His game will never be re-created in your lifetime or mine. His first retirement announcement doubled as one of the ten biggest sports moments of all time, one of three JFK-assassination-level moments for Generation X (along with the Challenger exploding and the O.J. car chase) where everyone my age remembers where they heard the news. He became the focal point of the world&rsquo;s single biggest health crisis in seventy-five years. And all of these things somehow happened between March &rsquo;79 and August &rsquo;92.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBeyond that, he remains the most breathtaking player who ever ran a fast break &ndash; better than Cousy, better than Nash, better than anyone &ndash; because his height, huge hands, Gretzky-like vision and sneaky-long arms allowed him to reach the rim faster than opponents anticipated. (I grew up in a sports world that had seven certainties: you weren&rsquo;t stopping Kareem&rsquo;s sky hook, you weren&rsquo;t covering Rice with one guy, you weren&rsquo;t blocking LT with one guy, you couldn&rsquo;t let Gretzky hang behind the net on a power play, you weren&rsquo;t sacking Marino, you weren&rsquo;t getting Boggs to chase a bad pitch and you weren&rsquo;t stopping Magic on a three-on-one.) And he&rsquo;s the single best leader in the history of the sport. Nobody extracted more from teammates, whether it was an All-Star Game, a mundane affair in December or any playoff game.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDigging a little further, only two modern players (Bird and Magic) played with enough unselfishness and intuition that those qualities permeated to everyone else. They lifted their teammates offensively much the way Russell lifted his teammates defensively, a domino effect that can&rsquo;t be measured by any statistic or formula other than wins. Play with Bird or Magic long enough and you started seeing angles that you&rsquo;d never ordinarily see&hellip; and that went for the fans, too.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJordan may have peaked as the greatest individual player ever, but he never brought everyone else to a different level like Bird and Magic did.

I&rsquo;d rather have those three extra Magic years. And if I get struck by lightning or a telephone pole falls on me, so be it.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBird filled box scores to the degree that Boston reporters started a fantasy league modeled after Bird&rsquo;s all-around brilliance in 1984 or 1985; as far as I can discern, it was the first of its kind. They threw in money, drafted teams of players, added up their points, rebounds and assists (the 42 Club premise, basically), and the team with the highest total took the prize. Since Bird was the obvious number one pick, they called it the Larry Bird League. Larry even drew their draft order for the first few years &ndash; or so they claimed. When people are creating fantasy leagues and naming them after you, you&rsquo;re breaking new ground, no? So how do we measure that impact? I created a simple formula that&rsquo;s the bastard cousin of the 42 Club &ndash; add up a player&rsquo;s final placements in the NBA&rsquo;s yearly rankings for points, rebounds and assists per game. The lower the number, the better. For instance, Bird ranked second in points, eighth in rebounds and nineteenth in assists in 1985. So&hellip;2 + 8 + 19 = 29That&rsquo;s a better score than you think. If we made 33 the cut-off point, limited the list to players who made the top twenty in all three categories, only counted post-Russell players and called it the Legends Club, only eleven post-1969 seasons qualify: 1976 Kareem (18), 1972 Kareem (21), 2003 Garnett (24), 1986 Bird (25), 1974 Kareem (26), 1979 Kareem (26), 1985 Bird (27), 1984 Bird (30), 1970 Billy Cunningham (31), 1981 Bird (32), 1982 Bird (33). That&rsquo;s it. Magic didn&rsquo;t make it. Neither did Jordan or LeBron. Bird made it four times and nearly five (with 35 in 1987). He&rsquo;s also one of three players to crack the top fifty all-time in the three most relevant per-game career categories. As well as the top 75. And the top 100. And the top 125.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnd we didn&rsquo;t even mention that he&rsquo;s the ninth-best free throw shooter ever (89 percent), or that he came within a heartbeat of being the only member of the career 50&ndash;40&ndash;90 Percentage Club (finishing with 50% FG, 38% 3FG, and 89% FT). That&rsquo;s the crazy thing about Bird: his game was never about stats, but nobody put up numbers quite like his. So, there you go.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLet&rsquo;s say Bird bridged the gap between newspapers and the Internet for the forward position.

I&rsquo;ve never played on a team that had everything before.&rdquo; He left out the biggest reason: Magic jumped a level and cruised to his first MVP, submitting his best statistical year (regular season: 24-6-12; playoffs: 22-8-12, 53% FG and an impossible 78-13 assist/turnover ratio in the Finals) and gently yanking control from a declining Kareem. They got faster instead of bigger, dumping Maurice Lucas and Mitch Kupchak, handing their minutes to Green and Rambis and routinely going small ball with Magic-Scott-Coop-Worthy-Kareem. They mastered the art of juggling transition and half-court offense, running on every opportunity and waiting for Kareem to drag his ass up the court otherwise. From there, they had three devastating options: Kareem posting up, Magic posting up (a new wrinkle) or Worthy facing up and beating slower forwards off the dribble. And of their two glaring weaknesses (defending quick point guards or dominant low-post scorers), one was miraculously solved when San Antonio gift-wrapped Mychal Thompson and FedExed him to them for their stretch run.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Thompson trade would have sparked an Internet riot if it happened today (take how everyone reacted to the Pau Gasol hijacking, then square it): the Spurs were 18-31 and considering a full-fledged tank job with the David Robinson sweepstakes looming, unwilling to pay $1.4 million combined for Thompson and a decomposing Artis Gilmore. Lakers GM Jerry West barraged them with Thompson offers for a solid month, finally landing him for a pu-pu platter deluxe offer of Frank Brickowski, Petur Gudmundsson, a 1987 first-round pick (destined to be last) and cash. Everyone went crazy, and rightly so: Thompson was a former number one overall pick and one of the league&rsquo;s better low-post defenders. Within a week of the trade, Thompson played crunch time in a CBS game against Philly as everyone collectively said, &ldquo;My God, what the hell just happened?&rdquo; Thompson earned 22 minutes per game in the playoffs, rested Kareem for chunks of time, gave McHale fits and made the most underrated play of the Finals: when he jumped over Parish and McHale in Game 4 (foul! foul!) and caused Kareem&rsquo;s pivotal free throw to bounce off their hands, setting the stage for Magic&rsquo;s soul-wrenching baby hook. The Lakers also benefitted from Lenny Bias&rsquo; sudden death, a rash of Boston injuries, Houston&rsquo;s untimely demise and the up-and-coming Mavericks (55 wins, 3-2 against the Lakers) unexpectedly choking in the first round against Seattle. Since the playoffs expanded to sixteen teams in 1977, no Finals team ever played three worse conference opponents than the &rsquo;87 Lakers: in this case, the 37-win Nuggets (round 1), 42-win Warriors (round 2) and 39-win Sonics (round 3). Meanwhile, the banged-up Celtics faced MJ&rsquo;s 40-win Bulls and endured seven-game slugfests against a veteran 50-win Bucks team and the 52-win Pistons. Gee, who do you think was fresher for the Finals?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnd that&rsquo;s what makes ranking the &rsquo;87 Lakers so difficult.

Fans unfairly discounted Isiah&rsquo;s Pistons because they couldn&rsquo;t beat Boston or the Lakers at their peaks &ndash; even though they defeated Jordan&rsquo;s Bulls twice and won back-to-back titles &ndash; and because they lacked a dominant center or super-duper star, which confused everyone who didn&rsquo;t follow basketball obsessively. I hated these bastards, but grew to respect their hard-nosed swagger; they never allowed layups or dunks, never gave an inch, never stopped fighting and didn&rsquo;t care if they maimed you as long as they won. Their relentless competitiveness brought out the worst in opponents; I always found it fascinating that, for a team that ended up in so many fights, the Pistons never threw the first punch or had the most enraged guy in the brawl. And if you remember, the &rsquo;87 Celtics and &rsquo;88 Lakers spent so much energy fending them off that they were never the same afterwards.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo much of what the Pistons accomplished was based on intimidation and the understanding that they&rsquo;d do whatever it took to win, even if it meant intentionally stepping on McHale&rsquo;s broken foot (which Mahorn did repeatedly in &rsquo;87) or hammering Jordan and Pippen during their forays to the basket. For them, the mental game was bigger than anything. If you were frustrated by their elbows and shoves, if you were afraid of getting clocked every time you drove to the basket, if you were obsessing over punching Laimbeer instead of just thinking about ways to beat him&hellip; then they had you. That&rsquo;s what they wanted. You could say they figured out a loophole in the system and, after Pat Riley exploited that loophole even further with his bullying Knicks teams, the NBA finally stepped in and instituted taunting/fighting penalties and a system for flagrant fouls. If we&rsquo;re judging the &rsquo;89 Pistons against other landmark teams, the question remains: would they have succeeded to that degree with 2009 rules in place? Probably not. But they were so intelligent/competitive/versatile/bloodthirsty that those particular qualities translate to any era.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOne bummer for these guys: 1989-90 was a transition period with the Bird era slowing down, the Kareem era ending, the Jordan era not totally rolling yet, the Stockton-Malone era stalling, the Hakeem era floundering, the Ewing/Robinson/Barkley peaks still a few years away, and only the Bulls and Blazers rounding into legitimate contenders. The Pistons filled a void of sorts and became the Larry Holmes of NBA champs: unliked, resented and ultimately dismissed. We wanted them to go away and eventually, like Holmes, they did.

I&rsquo;m not arguing the season itself as much as its ceiling; when you consider that Philly had Moses in his prime, Doc and Bobby at the tail end, Toney emerging as an unstoppable offensive force, and Mo Cheeks doing Mo Cheeks things, as well as an overwhelming amount of motivation, of course they were going to look splendid that year.

They certainly weren&rsquo;t great defensively; only Cheeks and Jones were above average, and Jones was almost cooked. (Don&rsquo;t ask me who would have defended McHale, Duncan, Jordan, Kobe or Bird on this team because I have no clue.) Moses may have been one of the best rebounders ever (averaging a sterling 26-16 in the Playoffs), but any team with size (like the &rsquo;86 Celtics, for instance) would have toyed with Philly since they didn&rsquo;t have any other big guys. Their outside shooting was more than a little sketchy; only Cheeks and Toney could make anything beyond 15 feet, and nobody had three-point range. Not to belabor the point about their crummy supporting cast, but did we mention that the &rsquo;83 Sixers started Marc Iavaroni, a homeless man&rsquo;s Kurt Rambis who wouldn&rsquo;t have sniffed a nine-man rotation on a contender even six years later?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHow do we know for sure that the &rsquo;83 Sixers were overrated?
